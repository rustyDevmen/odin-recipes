    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    
      <ul>

        <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macroni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/3 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <!-- Really impressed I spelled this right the first time-->
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Worcesteshire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>

      </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    
      <ol>
        <!-- Feels a bit silly ordering a list and then listing Step n but I didn't have a better name for the steps -->
        <li>Step 1</li>
          <p>Preheat oven to <strong>400</strong> degrees F (200 degrees C)</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
          <p>
            Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. 
            Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, 
            stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked through but still slightly firm, about 8 minutes. 
            Drain well.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li> 
          <p>
            Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. When the butter starts to foam and bubble, 
            stir in the flour; cook on medium heat until flour just begins to turn pale yellow, 3 to 4 minutes. 
            Add thyme, cayenne pepper, and white pepper; cook and stir another minute, then whisk in 1 cup of milk 
            until smooth. Pour in remaining milk and whisk again. Bring the sauce just to a simmer.
          </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
          <p>
            Stir in nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, and salt; simmer on medium-low heat until thickened, about 8 minutes, whisking often. Turn heat off, then add 2 1/4 cups of Cheddar cheese; stir until melted and combined. Add Dijon mustard.
          </p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
          <p>
            Transfer the macaroni into a casserole dish, then pour in the cheese sauce; stir to thoroughly combine sauce with pasta. Mix panko bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon melted butter in a small bowl, and sprinkle crumbs on top of macaroni and cheese. Sprinkle remaining 3/4 cup of Cheddar cheese on top.
          </p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until bread crumbs and Cheddar cheese topping are golden brown, about 20 minutes.
        </p>
